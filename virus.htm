					<br>
					<h4>Tales of Church Fenton</h4>
					<p class="textJustify">We hope that you are all coping with the government lockdown and are supporting your neighbours. We need your help. We would like you to take this time out of our normal daily lives to reflect on where you live and our surroundings. It's good to talk, we want everyone to talk to one another, either through video calling or on your daily exercise. We are thinking about organising a "Tales of Church Fenton" publication.</p>
					<p class="textJustify">Whether you have lived in the village all your life, have seen the changes to our landscape or you are new to the area, we would like to hear from you. You can interview your neighbour over the fence, if you know of someone who lives alone, you can visit them, talk to them through a window or over the garden fence (keeping your social distance at all times). If you live alone or would like to write your own tales of life in the village, please do so.</p>
					<p class="textJustify">We haven't yet decided what form this publication will take, but the reality is, this all depends on you. We want this to be all about our residents. We would particularly like to hear from those of you who have lived here a long time, reminisce about the days of Air Displays and the Junction, the Pathfinders group or the Youth Club in the Old School, whatever your story, we would like to hear from you. It would be great to hear from anyone from 4yrs old to 104 years old!</p>
					<p class="textJustify">Once you have written your tales, please drop it off or send it over.</p>
					<p class="textJustify"><strong>Drop off point:</strong> Village Hall postbox or email: <a href="mailto:clerk.churchfentonpc@gmail.com" target="_blank">clerk.churchfentonpc@gmail.com</a><br><strong>What we need:</strong> A story of your life in the village<br><strong>The end result:</strong> We will compile all your anecdotes</p>
					<br>
					<h4>Children's Activities</h4>
					<p class="textJustify"><strong>We're going on a Bear Hunt - Something for the younger ones</strong><br>You may have seen the article on the BBC recently. Please put a bear in the window so that young children on their daily exercises can give your bear a wave. We're going on a Bear Hunt is a fantastic children's storybook and we would love to give the little ones something to look forward to on their walk around the village. If you're not going out, try Cosmic Yoga, We're going on a Bear Hunt - it's great fun. Just search Cosmic Yoga on YouTube, there are lots to try ... Moana, Harry Potter and Frozen, to name but a few. 20 minutes of daily exercise and it is lots of fun too!</p>
					<p class="textJustify"><strong>Older Children/ Adults</strong><br>For the slighter older children, try David Walliams Elevenses, he is releasing a new audio book daily - <a href="https://www.worldofdavidwalliams.com/elevenses" target="_blank">https://www.worldofdavidwalliams.com/elevenses</a> very enjoyable to listen to.<br>If you're missing the gym and want something a little more energetic than Cosmic Yoga, try P.E. with Joe - Joe Wicks is releasing a daily PE lesson at 9am. 30 minutes of exercise to kick start your day.</p>
